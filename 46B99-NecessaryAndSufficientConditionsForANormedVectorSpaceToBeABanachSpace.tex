{\bf Theorem 1 -} Let $(X,\| \cdot \|)$ be a normed vector space. $X$ is a Banach space if and only if  every absolutely
 convergent series in $X$ is convergent, i.e., whenever $\sum_n \|x_n\| < \infty,$ $\sum_n x_n$ converges in $X$.

{\bf Theorem 2 -} Let $X, Y$ be normed vector spaces, $X \ne 0$. Let $B(X,Y)$ be the space of bounded operators $X \longrightarrow Y$. Then
 $Y$ is a Banach space if and only if $B(X,Y)$ is a Banach space.
