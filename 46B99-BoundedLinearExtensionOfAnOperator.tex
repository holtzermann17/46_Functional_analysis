\subsection{Bounded Linear Extension}

Let $X$ and $Y$ be normed vector spaces and denote by $\widetilde{X}$ and $\widetilde{Y}$ their completions.

$\,$

{\bf Theorem 1 -} Every bounded linear operator $T:X \longrightarrow Y$ can be extended to a bounded linear operator $\widetilde{T} : \widetilde{X} \longrightarrow \widetilde{Y}$. Moreover, this extension is unique and $\|T\| = \|\widetilde{T}\|$.

$\,$

In particular, if $Y$ is a Banach space and $S \subseteq X$ is a (not necessarily \PMlinkname{closed}{ClosedSet}) subspace of $X$, an operator $T:S \longrightarrow Y$ has an extension $\widetilde{T} : \overline{S} \longrightarrow Y$ to $\overline{S}$ (the \PMlinkname{closure}{Closure} of $S$), which is unique and such that $\|T\|= \|\widetilde{T}\|$.

\subsection{Functorial Property of the Extension}

The extension of bounded linear operators between two normed vector spaces to their completions is functorial. More precisely, let $\mathbf{NVec}$ be the category of normed vector spaces (whose \PMlinkname{morphisms}{Category} are the bounded linear operators) and $\mathbf{Ban}$ the categroy of Banach spaces (whose \PMlinkescapetext{morphisms} are also the bounded linear operators). We have that

$\,$

{\bf Theorem 2 -} The completion $\,\widetilde{\,} : \mathbf{NVec} \longrightarrow \mathbf{Ban}$, which associates each normed vector space $X$ with its completion $\widetilde{X}$ and each bounded linear operator $T$ with its extension $\widetilde{T}$, is a covariant functor.

$\,$

This, in particular, implies that $\widetilde{T_1T_2} = \widetilde{T_1}\widetilde{T_2}$.

\subsection{Extensions in Spaces with Additional Structure}

When the normed vector spaces $X$ and $Y$ have some additional structure (for example, when $X$ and $Y$ are normed algebras) it is interesting to know if the (unique) extension of a morphism $T:X \longrightarrow Y$ preserves the additional structure. The following theorem states that this indeed the case for normed algebras or normed *-algebras.

$\,$

{\bf Theorem 3 -} If $X$ and $Y$ be normed vector spaces that are also normed algebras (normed *-algebras) and $T:X \longrightarrow Y$ is a bounded homomorphism (bounded *-homomorphism), then the unique bounded linear extension $\widetilde{T}$ of $T$ is also an homomorphism (*-homomorphism).

$\,$

Thus, completion is also a covariant functor from the category of normed algebras (normed *-algebras) to category of Banach algebras (Banach *-algebras).
