Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a \PMlinkname{$C^*$-algebra}{CAlgebra}. Let $\mathcal{A}^+$ denote the set of positive elements of $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{A}_{sa}$ denote the set of self-adjoint elements of $\mathcal{A}$.

Since $\mathcal{A}^+$ is a \PMlinkname{proper convex cone}{Cone5} (see this \PMlinkname{entry}{PositiveElement3}), we can define a partial order $\leq$ on the set $\mathcal{A}_{sa}$, by setting
\begin{center}
$a\leq b$ if and only if $b-a \in \mathcal{A}^+$, i.e. $b-a$ is positive.
\end{center} 

{\bf Theorem -} The relation $\leq$ is a partial order relation on $\mathcal{A}_{sa}$. Moreover, $\leq$ turns $\mathcal{A}_{sa}$ into an ordered topological vector space.

\subsubsection{Properties:}

\begin{itemize}
\item $a\leq b \;\Rightarrow\; c^*a\,c\leq c^*b\,c\;\;$ for every $c \in \mathcal{A}$.
\item If $a$ and $b$ are invertible and $a \leq b$, then $b^{-1} \leq a^{-1}$.
\item If $\mathcal{A}$ has an identity element $e$, then $-\|a\|e \leq a \leq \|a\|e\;$ for every $a \in \mathcal{A}_{sa}$.
\item $-b \leq a \leq b \;\Rightarrow \;\|a\| \leq \|b\|$.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Remark:}
The proof that $\leq$ is partial order makes no use of the self-adjointness \PMlinkescapetext{property}. In fact, $\mathcal{A}$ itself is an ordered topological vector space under the relation $\leq$.

However, it turns out that this ordering relation provides its most usefulness when restricted to self-adjoint elements. For example, some of the above \PMlinkescapetext{properties} would not hold if we did not restrict to $\mathcal{A}_{sa}$.
