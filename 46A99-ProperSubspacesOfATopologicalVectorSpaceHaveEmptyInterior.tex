{\bf Theorem -} Let $V$ be a topological vector space. Every proper subspace $S \subset V$ has empty interior.

{\bf Proof :} Let $S$ be a subspace of $V$. Suppose there is a non-empty open set $A \subseteq S$.

Fix a point $a_0 \in A \subseteq S$. Since the vector sum operation is continuous, translations of open sets are again open sets. In particular, the set $A - a_0 := \{x-a_0 : x \in A\}$ is an open set of $V$ that contains the origin $0$.

As $S$ is a vector subspace and $A \subseteq S$, we see that the translation $A-a_0$ is still contained in $S$.

Since the scalar multiplication operation is continuous it follows easily that, for every $x \in V$, the function $f_x: \mathbb{K} \longrightarrow V$ given by
\begin{displaymath}
f_x (\lambda) = \lambda x
\end{displaymath}
is also continuous.

Consider now any vector $v \in V$. The set $f_v^{-1}(A-a_0)$ is an open set that contains $0$. Thus, taking a value $\lambda \in f_v^{-1}(A-a_0)$ we see that
\begin{displaymath}
\lambda v \in A-a_0 ,
\end{displaymath}
i.e. we can multiply $v$ by a sufficiently small $\lambda$ such that $\lambda v$ belongs to the open set $A - a_0$.

Since the set $A- a_0$ is contained in $S$, we see that $\lambda v \in S$, and therefore $v \in S$.

This proves that $V=S$, i.e. $S$ is not proper.

We conclude that if $S$ is proper then $S$ has empty interior. $\square$
