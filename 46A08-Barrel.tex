\begin{document}
Let $V$ be a topological vector space (TVS).  A \emph{barrel} $B$ is a subset of $V$ that is closed, convex, \PMlinkname{balanced}{BalancedSet}, and absorbing.  For example, in a Banach space $A$, any ball $\lbrace v\in A\mid ||v||\le r\rbrace$ for some $r>0$ is a barrel.

A topological vector space is said to be a \emph{barrelled space} if it is \PMlinkname{locally convex}{LocallyConvexTopologicalVectorSpace}, and every barrel is a neighborhood of $0$.  Every Banach space is a barrelled space.

A weaker form of a barrelled space is that of an \emph{infrabarrelled space}.  A TVS is said to be \emph{infrabarrelled} if it is locally convex, and every barrel that absorbs every bounded set is a neighborhood of $0$.

Let $V$ be a vector space and $\mathfrak{T}$ be the set of all those topologies on $V$ making $V$ a TVS.  In other words, if $T\in \mathfrak{T}$, then $(V,T)$ is a topological vector space.

Let $V$ and $T\in \mathfrak{T}$ be defined as above.  Then $(V,T)$ being barrelled has an equivalent characterization below:
\begin{quote}
(*) for any $T_1\in \mathfrak{T}$ such that there is a \PMlinkname{neighborhood base}{LocalBase} of $0$ consisting of $T$-closed sets, then $T_1$ is coarser than $T$.
\end{quote}

A variation of a barrelled space is that of an \emph{ultrabarrelled space}.  A topological vector space is said to be \emph{ultrabarrelled} if it satisfies (*) above.  A locally convex ultrabarrelled space is barrelled.
