{\bf Theorem -} Let $X$ be a Banach space and $M$ a closed subspace. Then $X/M$ with the quotient norm is a
 Banach space.

{\bf Proof :} In {\PMlinkescapetext{order}} to prove that $X/M$ is a Banach space it is enough to prove that every series in $X/M$
 that converges absolutely also converges in $X/M$.

Let $\sum_{n} X_n$ be an absolutely convergent series in $X/M$, i.e., $\sum_{n} \|X_n\|_{X/M} < \infty$.
By definition of the quotient norm, there exists $x_n \in X_n$ such that

\begin{displaymath}
\|x_n \| \le \|X_n \|_{X/M} + 2^{-n}
\end{displaymath}

It is clear that $\sum_{n} \|x_n\| < \infty$ and so, as $X$ is a Banach space, $\sum_{n} x_n$ is
 convergent.

Let $x = \sum_{n} x_n$ and $s_k = \sum_{n=1}^k x_n$. We have that

\begin{displaymath}
x - s_k + M = (x+M) - (s_k +M) = (x+M) - \sum_{n=1}^k (x_n +M) = (x+M) - \sum_{n=1}^k X_n
\end{displaymath}

Since $\|x-s_k + M \|_{X/M} \leq \|x-s_k\| \longrightarrow 0$ we see that $\sum_n X_n$ converges in $X/M$
 to $x+M$. $\square$
